<!--Project Overview-->
## Project Overview
Starbucks provided simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.

<!--Project Components-->
## Project Components
The goal of this project is to combine transcations, demographics and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. 
*	Exploratory Data Analysis on individual datasets provided
*   Combine data and visualize to answer questions about demographic groups.
*   Split the data into train and test datasets.
*   Build predictive machine learning model to predict customer response to an offer.
*   Compare metrics of different models on test datasets.

<!--File descriptions-->
## File descriptions
*   The data is contained in three files:

    *   portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
    *   profile.json - demographic data for each customer
    *   transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
